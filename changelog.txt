  Features:
    - Spidertron Dock is now a standalone mod, split off from Space Spidertron.
      - Spidertron Dock only supports Space Spidertron V1.3 or newer, but is not dependent on it.
    - Dock now supports the circuit network by using a Dock Interface:
      - Supports switching between Passive and Active docking modes.
      - Supports undocking the currently docked spider.
      - Supports recalling the last docked spider.
      - Outputs a signal when the dock is occupied.
  Changes:
    - Docking mode is toggled through the R-button only when the player's cursor is empty.
