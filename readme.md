A spidertron dock designed to be used with [Space Exploration](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration)'s spaceships. It safetely tucks away the spider on the spaceship, and could lower the required integrity dependent on the docking mode.

## Features:
- When docked in `passive` mode the docked spidertron wil cost _zero_ integrity, however it's functionality will be fully disabled.
- When docked in `active` mode the docked spidertron will still cost integrity, but will still be fully functional.
- Circuit controllable through a `Spidertron Dock Interface`, intended to be used with mods like [Constructron](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Constructron-Continued).

**Note:** This mod's functionality was originally part of the mod [Space Spidertron](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-spidertron).
